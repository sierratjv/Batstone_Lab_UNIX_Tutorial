# Learning Bash Shell 

## UNIX
UNIX is an operating system. There are different versions of unix: AIX, HP/UX, SunOS, ULTRIX, OSX, FreeBSD, LINUX. The UNIX is made up of kernel, shell, and programs. The kernel distributes time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response to system calls. The shell is a command-line interpreter. The shell has different versions, for example, sh, csh, tcsh, ksh, bash, zsh. When a user typies a command, the shell searches the filestore for a program to run that command and requests the kernel to execute the program. 

This tutorial will be done in bash shell.
