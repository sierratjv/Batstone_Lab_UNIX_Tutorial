# Learning Bash  
**For Windows computers, download the free version of MobaXterm (https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/). For Apple computers, use the Terminal application.**

# UNIX
UNIX is an operating system. There are different versions of UNIX: AIX, HP/UX, SunOS, ULTRIX, OSX, FreeBSD, LINUX, and so on. The UNIX is made up of kernel, shell, and programs. The kernel distributes time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response to system calls. The shell is a command-line interpreter. The shell has different versions: sh (Bourne shell), csh (C shell), tcsh (TENEX C Shell
), ksh (KornShell), bash (Bourne Again Shell), zsh (Z shell). When a user typies a command, the shell searches the filestore for a program to run that command and requests the kernel to execute the program. 

This tutorial will be done in bash.

**This section shows how to get an account for info cluster and compute canada clusters.**

**A reason why to use computer clusters:** <br>
*"If you have a program that takes months to run on your PC, you could probably run it within a few hours using hundreds of processors on SHARCNET / Compute Canada clusters, provided your program is inherently parallelisable. If you have hundreds or thousands of test cases to run through on your PC or computers in your lab, then with hundreds of processors running those cases independently will significantly reduce your test cycles." -- What can I do with SHARCNET? https://helpwiki.sharcnet.ca/wiki/FAQ#About_SHARCNET*
